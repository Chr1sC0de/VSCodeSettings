# Latex

VSCode has some nice tools which allows for direct and easy editing of latex
files. An all-one extension to use is
[Latex Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop).
For Latex Workshop to work a LaTeX distribution will be required, the two most
popular are,

- [Miktex](https://miktex.org/)
- [Tex Live](https://tug.org/texlive/)

## Word Wrapping

When writing in LaTeX in VSCode the words may not automatically wrap to a new
line. To enable auto word wrap we can use the `Alt+F1` shortcut to we can do so
from the command palette by typing `toggle word wrap`. Note however that
enabling word wrap way may cause issues with vim.

## Reference Handling

When handling references it is common to use a `.bib` file. It can become a
hassle copying and pasting references, maintaining keys and checking for
integrity. Luckily for us there are a lot of reference handling software
available, to name a few,

- [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop-new/)
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
- [Bookends](https://www.sonnysoftware.com/bookends/bookends.html)
- [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/)

I personally use JabRef, but any form of reference handling can make things
significantly easier when writing scientific articles.

## Spell Checking

Can be performed either using
[Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright)
or [Code Spell Check](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker).
I personally use Spell Right.

## Grammar

For grammar checking we can use [LTeX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=valentjn.vscode-ltex)
